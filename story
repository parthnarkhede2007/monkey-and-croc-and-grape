which was on a banls of teh river. In the same forest lived a crocodile and his wife....
crocodile was sad 
one day the crcodile came to the banks of theriver and rested under the tree.
the kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. Crocodile came back the next day for more fruits,
as he loved them. As days passed by, the crocodile became good friends.

GOOD ENDING.
